      Off the Pike is a pop-up restaurant run by Arlington Tech students in the culinary 
      arts program. The restaurant opens around Halloween, Valentineâ€™s Day and other holidays. 
      The students who help to operate Off the Pike gain hands-on experience while generating 
      funds for the culinary arts program. Typically, the fundraiser generates around 1,000 to 
      1,500 dollars.
