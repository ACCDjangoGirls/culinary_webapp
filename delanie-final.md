I worked on some CSS code that wouldn't make any *drastic* changes to the website, but *would* tie everything together; things like font(s), margins, padding, etc.

<p>the hardest thing for me to do was take off the bullet points from the sign up page because I had to figure out where this project's code ended and where all auth started, 
where allauth's html was, and how to edit it.</p>
<p> turns out i just needed to cmd+shift+r. hooray, i guess.</p>
